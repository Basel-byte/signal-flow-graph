# Problem statement

Given nodes and branches of a signal flow graph, The program does the following :

- Draw the signal flow graph showing nodes, branches, gains, …
- List:
  - all forward paths
  - all individual loops
  - all combination of n non-touching loops.
- The values of delta , delta1 , …, delta-m where m is number of forward paths.
- Calculate overall system transfer function.
